This is a project I made for my programming final project in Year 1

It is a visual novel that includes many characters (my friends) and my professors
Its features includes:
- A D&D-like point buy system
- A dice roll system that incorporates stats
- A quiz system
- Multiple outcomes based on your dialogue choices
- A Tkinter UI

  This being my first "complete" "game" I ever made, it has some flaws. The story isn't very complete and many stats are not used at all.
  The branching dialogue system uses hard code and an absurd amount of elifs. I tried using a .json file to put the dialogue outside the game file but I wasn't able to implement it.
  I hope that this can be a stepping stone to better projects in the future.
  If you want to play this game, just extract "Project Dos.rar" to any folder you want it to be and run the python file.
  Thank you so much for reading this, whoever you are.
